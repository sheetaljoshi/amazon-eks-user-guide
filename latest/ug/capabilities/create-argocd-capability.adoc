This topic explains how to create an Argo CD capability on your Amazon EKS cluster.

== Prerequisites

Before creating an Argo CD capability, ensure you have:

* An existing Amazon EKS cluster running a supported Kubernetes version (all versions in standard and extended support are supported)
* *{aws} Identity Center configured* - Required for Argo CD authentication (local users are not supported)
* An IAM Capability Role with permissions for Argo CD
* Sufficient IAM permissions to create capability resources on EKS clusters
* `kubectl` configured to communicate with your cluster
* (Optional) The Argo CD CLI installed for easier cluster and repository management
* (For CLI/eksctl) The appropriate CLI tool installed and configured

For instructions on creating the IAM Capability Role, see <<capability-role>>.
For Identity Center setup, see link:singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html[Getting started with {aws} Identity Center,type="documentation"].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The IAM Capability Role you provide determines which {aws} resources Argo CD can access.
This includes Git repository access via CodeConnections and secrets in Secrets Manager.
For guidance on creating an appropriate role with least-privilege permissions, see <<capability-role>> and <<capabilities-security>>.
====

== Choose your tool

You can create an Argo CD capability using the {aws-management-console}, {aws} CLI, or eksctl:

* <<argocd-create-console>> - Use the Console for a guided experience
* <<argocd-create-cli>> - Use the {aws} CLI for scripting and automation
* <<argocd-create-eksctl>> - Use eksctl for a Kubernetes-native experience

== What happens when you create an Argo CD capability

When you create an Argo CD capability:

. EKS creates the Argo CD capability service and configures it to monitor and manage resources in your cluster
. Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) are installed in your cluster
. The capability assumes the IAM Capability Role you provide
. Argo CD begins watching for its custom resources
. The capability status changes from `CREATING` to `ACTIVE`
. The Argo CD UI becomes accessible through its endpoint 

Once active, you can create Argo CD Applications in your cluster to deploy from Git repositories.

== Next steps

After creating the Argo CD capability:

* <<working-with-argocd>> - Configure repository access, register target clusters, and create Applications
* <<argocd-concepts>> - Learn about GitOps principles, sync policies, and multi-cluster patterns
* <<argocd-considerations>> - Explore multi-cluster architecture patterns and advanced configuration
