Deploy and manage applications using GitOps with the Argo CD managed capability.
--

With Argo CD, you define applications in Git repositories and Argo CD automatically syncs them to your Kubernetes clusters.
This enables declarative, version-controlled application deployment with automated drift detection.

== Prerequisites

Before working with Argo CD, you need:

* An EKS cluster with the Argo CD capability created (see <<create-argocd-capability>>)
* A Git repository containing Kubernetes manifests
* `kubectl` configured to communicate with your cluster

== Common tasks

The following topics guide you through common Argo CD tasks:

*<<argocd-configure-repositories>>* - Configure Argo CD to access your Git repositories using {aws} Secrets Manager, {aws} CodeConnections, or Kubernetes Secrets.

*<<argocd-register-clusters>>* - Register target clusters where Argo CD will deploy applications.

*<<argocd-projects>>* - Organize applications and enforce security boundaries using Projects for multi-tenant environments.

*<<argocd-create-application>>* - Create Applications that deploy from Git repositories with automated or manual sync policies.

*<<argocd-applicationsets>>* - Use ApplicationSets to deploy applications across multiple environments or clusters using templates and generators.

== Access the Argo CD UI

Access the Argo CD UI through the EKS console:

. Open the Amazon EKS console
. Select your cluster
. Choose the *Capabilities* tab
. Choose *Argo CD*
. Choose *Open Argo CD UI*

The UI provides visual application topology, sync status and history, resource health and events, manual sync controls, and application management.
