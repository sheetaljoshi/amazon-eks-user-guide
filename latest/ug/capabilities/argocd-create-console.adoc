= Create an Argo CD capability using the Console
:info_titleabbrev: Console

This topic describes how to create an Argo CD capability using the {aws-management-console}.

== Prerequisites

* *{aws} Identity Center configured* – Argo CD requires {aws} Identity Center for authentication. Local users are not supported. If you don't have {aws} Identity Center set up, see link:singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html[Getting started with {aws} Identity Center,type="documentation"] to create an Identity Center instance, and link:singlesignon/latest/userguide/addusers.html[Add users,type="documentation"] and link:singlesignon/latest/userguide/addgroups.html[Add groups,type="documentation"] to create users and groups for Argo CD access.

== Create the Argo CD capability

. Open the Amazon EKS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home#/clusters.

. Select your cluster name to open the cluster detail page.

. Choose the *Capabilities* tab.

. In the left navigation, choose *Argo CD*.

. Choose *Create Argo CD capability*.

. For *IAM Capability Role*:
+
* If you already have an IAM Capability Role, select it from the dropdown
* If you need to create a role, choose *Create Argo CD role*
+
This opens the IAM console in a new tab with pre-populated trust policy and full read access to Secrets Manager.
No other permissions are added by default, but you can add them if needed.
If you plan to use CodeCommit repositories or other {aws} services, add the appropriate permissions before creating the role.
+
After creating the role, return to the EKS console and the role will be automatically selected.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you plan to use the optional integrations with {aws} Secrets Manager or {aws} CodeConnections, you'll need to add permissions to the role.
For IAM policy examples and configuration guidance, see <<integration-secrets-manager>> and <<integration-codeconnections>>.
====

. Configure {aws} Identity Center integration:
+
.. Select *Enable {aws} Identity Center integration*.
.. Choose your Identity Center instance from the dropdown.
.. Configure role mappings for RBAC by assigning users or groups to Argo CD roles (ADMIN, EDITOR, or VIEWER)

. Choose *Create*.

The capability creation process begins.

== Verify the capability is active

. On the *Capabilities* tab, view the Argo CD capability status.

. Wait for the status to change from `CREATING` to `ACTIVE`.

. Once active, the capability is ready to use.

For information about capability statuses and troubleshooting, see <<working-with-capabilities>>.

== Access the Argo CD UI

After the capability is active, you can access the Argo CD UI:

. On the Argo CD capability page, choose *Open Argo CD UI*.

. The Argo CD UI opens in a new browser tab.

. You can now create Applications and manage deployments through the UI.
