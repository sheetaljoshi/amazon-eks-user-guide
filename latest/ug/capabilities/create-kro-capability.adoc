Learn how to create a kro (Kube Resource Orchestrator) capability on your Amazon EKS cluster using the Console, {aws} CLI, or eksctl.

This topic explains how to create a kro capability on your Amazon EKS cluster.

== Prerequisites

Before creating a kro capability, ensure you have:

* An existing Amazon EKS cluster running a supported Kubernetes version (all versions in standard and extended support are supported)
* Sufficient IAM permissions to create capability resources on EKS clusters
* (For CLI/eksctl) The appropriate CLI tool installed and configured

[NOTE]
====
Unlike ACK and Argo CD, kro does not require additional IAM permissions beyond the trust policy.
kro operates entirely within your cluster and does not make {aws} API calls.
However, you still need to provide an IAM Capability Role with the appropriate trust policy.
For information about configuring Kubernetes RBAC permissions for kro, see <<kro-permissions>>.
====

== Choose your tool

You can create a kro capability using the {aws-management-console}, {aws} CLI, or eksctl:

* <<kro-create-console>> - Use the Console for a guided experience
* <<kro-create-cli>> - Use the {aws} CLI for scripting and automation
* <<kro-create-eksctl>> - Use eksctl for a Kubernetes-native experience

== What happens when you create a kro capability

When you create a kro capability:

. EKS creates the kro capability service and configures it to monitor and manage resources in your cluster
. Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) are installed in your cluster
. The capability assumes the IAM Capability Role you provide (used only for the trust relationship)
. kro begins watching for `ResourceGraphDefinition` resources and their instances
. The capability status changes from `CREATING` to `ACTIVE`

Once active, you can create ResourceGraphDefinitions to define custom APIs and create instances of those APIs.

== Next steps

After creating the kro capability:

* <<kro-concepts>> - Understand kro concepts and resource composition
* <<kro-concepts>> - Learn about SimpleSchema, CEL expressions, and resource composition patterns
