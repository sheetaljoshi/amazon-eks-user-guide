Learn how to create an {aws} Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK) capability on your Amazon EKS cluster using the Console, {aws} CLI, or eksctl.
--

This chapter explains how to create an ACK capability on your Amazon EKS cluster.

== Prerequisites

Before creating an ACK capability, ensure you have:

* An Amazon EKS cluster 
* An IAM Capability Role with permissions for ACK to manage {aws} resources
* Sufficient IAM permissions to create capability resources on EKS clusters
* The appropriate CLI tool installed and configured, or access to the EKS Console

For instructions on creating the IAM Capability Role, see <<capability-role>>.

[IMPORTANT]
====
ACK is an infrastructure management capability that grants the ability to create, modify, and delete {aws} resources.
This is an admin-scoped capability that should be carefully controlled.
Anyone with permission to create Kubernetes resources in your cluster can effectively create {aws} resources through ACK, subject to the IAM Capability Role permissions.
The IAM Capability Role you provide determines which {aws} resources ACK can create and manage.
For guidance on creating an appropriate role with least-privilege permissions, see <<capability-role>> and <<capabilities-security>>.
====

== Choose your tool

You can create an ACK capability using the {aws-management-console}, {aws} CLI, or eksctl:

* <<ack-create-console>> - Use the Console for a guided experience
* <<ack-create-cli>> - Use the {aws} CLI for scripting and automation
* <<ack-create-eksctl>> - Use eksctl for a Kubernetes-native experience

== What happens when you create an ACK capability

When you create an ACK capability:

. EKS creates the ACK capability service and configures it to monitor and manage resources in your cluster
. Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) are installed in your cluster
. The capability assumes the IAM Capability Role you provide
. ACK begins watching for its custom resources in your cluster
. The capability status changes from `CREATING` to `ACTIVE`

Once active, you can create ACK custom resources in your cluster to manage {aws} resources.

== Next steps

After creating the ACK capability:

* <<ack-concepts>> - Understand ACK concepts and get started with {aws} resources
* <<ack-concepts>> - Learn about reconciliation, field exports, and resource adoption patterns
* <<ack-permissions>> - Configure IAM permissions and multi-account patterns
