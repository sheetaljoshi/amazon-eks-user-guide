= Comparing EKS Capability for ACK to self-managed ACK
:info_titleabbrev: Comparison to self-managed

[abstract]
--
Understand the differences between the EKS Capability for ACK and self-managed ACK controllers.
--

The EKS Capability for ACK provides the same functionality as self-managed ACK controllers, but with significant operational advantages.
For a general comparison of EKS Capabilities vs self-managed solutions, see <<capabilities-considerations>>.
This topic focuses on ACK-specific differences.

== Differences from upstream ACK

The EKS Capability for ACK is based on upstream ACK controllers but differs in IAM integration.

*IAM Capability Role*: The capability uses a dedicated IAM role with a trust policy that allows the `capabilities.eks.amazonaws.com` service principal, not IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts).
You can attach IAM policies directly to the Capability Role with no need to create or annotate Kubernetes service accounts or configure OIDC providers.
A best practice for production use cases is to configure service permissions using `IAMRoleSelector`.
See <<ack-permissions>> for more details.

*Resource compatibility*: ACK custom resources work identically to upstream ACK with no changes to your ACK resource YAML files.
The capability uses the same Kubernetes APIs and CRDs, so tools like `kubectl` work the same way.
All GA controllers and resources from upstream ACK are supported.

For complete ACK documentation and service-specific guides, see the https://aws-controllers-k8s.github.io/community/[ACK documentation^].


== Migration path

You can migrate from self-managed ACK to the managed capability with zero downtime:

. Update your self-managed ACK controller to use `kube-system` for leader election leases, for example:
+
[source,bash]
----
helm upgrade --install ack-s3-controller \
  oci://public.ecr.aws/aws-controllers-k8s/s3-chart \
  --namespace ack-system \
  --set leaderElection.namespace=kube-system
----
+
This moves the controller's lease to `kube-system`, allowing the managed capability to coordinate with it.

. Create the ACK capability on your cluster (see <<create-ack-capability>>)

. The managed capability recognizes existing ACK-managed {aws} resources and takes over reconciliation

. Gradually scale down or remove self-managed controller deployments:
+
[source,bash]
----
helm uninstall ack-s3-controller --namespace ack-system
----

This approach allows both controllers to coexist safely during migration.
The managed capability automatically adopts resources previously managed by self-managed controllers, ensuring continuous reconciliation without conflicts.
