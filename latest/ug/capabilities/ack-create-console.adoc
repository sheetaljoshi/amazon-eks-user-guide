= Create an ACK capability using the Console
:info_titleabbrev: Console

This topic describes how to create an {aws} Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK) capability using the {aws-management-console}.

== Create the ACK capability

. Open the Amazon EKS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home#/clusters.

. Select your cluster name to open the cluster detail page.

. Choose the *Capabilities* tab.

. In the left navigation, choose *{aws} Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK)*.

. Choose *Create {aws} Controllers for Kubernetes capability*.

. For *IAM Capability Role*:
+
* If you already have an IAM Capability Role, select it from the dropdown
* If you need to create a role, choose *Create admin role*
+
This opens the IAM console in a new tab with pre-populated trust policy and the `AdministratorAccess` managed policy. You can unselect this policy and add other permissions if you prefer.
+
After creating the role, return to the EKS console and the role will be automatically selected.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The suggested `AdministratorAccess` policy grants broad permissions and is intended to streamline getting started.
For production use, replace this with a custom policy that grants only the permissions needed for the specific {aws} services you plan to manage with ACK.
For guidance on creating least-privilege policies, see <<ack-permissions>> and <<capabilities-security>>.
====

. Choose *Create*.

The capability creation process begins.

== Verify the capability is active

. On the *Capabilities* tab, view the ACK capability status.

. Wait for the status to change from `CREATING` to `ACTIVE`.

. Once active, the capability is ready to use.

For information about capability statuses and troubleshooting, see <<working-with-capabilities>>.

== Verify custom resources are available

After the capability is active, verify that ACK custom resources are available in your cluster.

*Using the console*

. Navigate to your cluster in the Amazon EKS console
. Choose the *Resources* tab
. Choose *Extensions*
. Choose *CustomResourceDefinitions*

You should see a number of CRDs listed for {aws} resources.

*Using kubectl*

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
kubectl api-resources | grep services.k8s.aws
----

You should see a number of APIs listed for {aws} resources.

[NOTE]
====
The capability for {aws} Controllers for Kubernetes will install a number of CRDs for a variety of {aws} resources.

== Next steps

* <<ack-concepts>> - Understand ACK concepts and get started
* <<ack-permissions>> - Configure IAM permissions for other {aws} services
* <<working-with-capabilities>> - Manage your ACK capability resource
