= Use Amazon Q Developer on the Amazon EKS console
:info_titleabbrev: Amazon Q

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) integrates with Amazon Q to provide AI-powered troubleshooting directly in the {aws} Management Console. This integration helps you quickly investigate and resolve cluster, control plane, node, and workload issues with AI assistance from Amazon Q. 

== How it works

The Amazon EKS console displays **Inspect with Amazon Q** buttons contextually alongside errors or issues throughout the console. When you click this button, Amazon Q automatically analyzes the issue and opens a chat panel on the right side of the console with investigation results, root cause analysis, and suggested mitigation steps.

The integration appears in the following locations within the Amazon EKS console:

* **Cluster health** - Investigate cluster health issues and status messages in the Cluster health tab in observability dashboard
* **Control plane** - Troubleshoot control plane component errors and warnings  in Control plane monitoring in observability dashboard
* **Upgrade insights** - Analyze potential upgrade blockers and compatibility issues  in  Upgrade insights  in observability dashboard
* **Node health** - Investigate node-level issues affecting cluster capacity in Node health issues in observability dashboard
* **Workloads** - Analyze Kubernetes events on pods indicating failures or issues


== Using Amazon Q for troubleshooting

**To investigate an issue with Amazon Q**

1. Open the link:eks/home#/clusters[Amazon EKS console,type="console"].
2. Choose the name of the cluster to investigate.
3. When you encounter an error message or issue indicator, look for the **Inspect with Amazon Q** button. The button appears contextually next to the issue or in the error  status details view.
4. Choose **Inspect with Amazon Q**. 
5. Amazon Q automatically investigates the issue and displays the analysis in a chat panel on the right side of the console.
6. Review the investigation results, including root cause analysis and suggested mitigation steps.
7. You can continue the conversation by asking Amazon Q follow-up questions about the issue.

**Note**  
The Amazon Q integration only appears when there is an error, warning, or issue requiring investigation. It does not appear when resources are healthy.

== Considerations

Consider the following when using Amazon Q with Amazon EKS:


* **Read-only operations** - The Amazon Q integration performs only read operations on your cluster resources. It does not make any mutating or write actions to your cluster configuration or workloads.
* **Cross-region processing** - Amazon Q may process data across {aws} regions to provide AI-powered analysis. For more information about cross-region processing, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/cross-region-processing.html[Cross-region processing] in the _Amazon Q Developer User Guide_.
* **{aws} Management Console only** - This integration is available only through the {aws} Management Console. It is not available through the {aws} CLI, {aws} APIs, or infrastructure as code tools.
